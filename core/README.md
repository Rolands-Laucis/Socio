# Socio.js - WebSocket live/reactive API paradigm with Client-Side SQL queries. (under active early development)

## Connecting frontend to backend DB reactively!

Say goodbye to REST APIs. No more API middleware and DB interfacing functions and wrappers and handlers. Write your SQL queries on the frontend and have their results be automagically refreshed on all clients when a resource is changed on the server DB.

Check [basic demo](./demos/basic/README.md) to try an interactive bare-bones demonstration.
Check [secure framework demo](./demos/framework/README.md) to try an interactive demonstration on a Svelte-Vite app!

Comes with a class for auto securing the SQL, so no worries about injections. And even a simple Vite plugin that wraps it ü•≥

## TODOs üìù
* Session ID sync with backend webserver sessions
* Keyed SQL queries
* Better SQL dependency distinguisher on queries
* Typescript migration
* plenty more

# Dont be shy to try this out on your small project. Feedback from real world use cases is much appreciated ü•∞

## Name:
"Socio.js" comes from the latin verb "socio", which means to link or associate. Since this lib syncs your frontend and backend. Its also a play on words for "WebSockets" and "IO".
