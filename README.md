# Socio - A WebSocket based realtime duplex Full-stack synced API framework.

## Connecting your Front-End to Back-End DB reactively! ‚áÑ

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJIC9B3cKME&ab_channel=CepuminsLV" target="_blank">3 min Youtube video Demo</a>

No more API middleware and backend DB interfacing functions and wrappers and handlers. Write your SQL queries on the frontend and have their results be automagically refreshed on all clients when a resource is changed on the server DB. This is secure.

[Basic Demo](https://github.com/Rolands-Laucis/Socio/blob/master/demos/basic/readme.md) - interactive bare-bones demo project.

[Secure Full-Stack Framework Demo](https://github.com/Rolands-Laucis/Socio/tree/master/demos/full-stack_framework#readme) - interactive demo project with SvelteKit and Vite.

### Instalation
In your Node.js project root dir:
```bash
npm i socio
```

## How? ‚ú®

On the backend instantiate the ``SocioServer`` class and provide it a single DB (of your choice) raw query function, that will receive the SQL string and dynamic parameters object. The raw result of that is passed back to the caller on the client side, where the SQL and params sit - where an instance of ``SocioClient`` has made a .query() call. Using the same mechanism, an automagical subscription to that SQL resource can be registered via the .subscribe() method, that runs your callback function whenever the data this query relies upon has changed on the backend DB.

## What about SQL injections and overall data safety? üíâ

Included is a class for auto securing the SQL via server-side string symetric encryption run at build time using the AES-256-GCM algorithm.
Preventing the client seeing or altering the query string. Dynamic data inserted as query parameters should be sanitized by your DB interface function, since Socio passes the SQL and params to you seperately. Or you can wrap the DB interface function and sanatize them yourself.
In addition, all queries have opt-in flags for authentification and table permissions requirements, that are managed on the backend.

And even a simple Vite plugin that wraps this functionality for all of your front-end souce code ü•≥

## Code snippets

Written in TypeScript, but of course can use the lib in JS scripts just the same.

```ts
//TS server side
import { SocioServer } from 'socio/dist/core'; //this way for both JS and TS
import { SocioSecurity } from 'socio/dist/secure'; //this way for both JS and TS
import type { QueryFunction, QueryFuncParams } from 'socio/dist/core';
async function QueryWrap(client: SocioSession, id: id, sql: string, params: object | null = null):Promise<object> {
    //do whatever u need to run the sql on your DB and return its result
    //sanatize dynamic params!
}

const socsec = new SocioSecurity({ secure_private_key: '...', verbose:true }); //for decrypting incoming queries. This same key is used for encrypting the source files when you build and bundle them.
const socserv = new SocioServer({ port: 3000 }, { DB_query_function: QueryWrap as QueryFunction, verbose: true, socio_security: socsec }); //creates localhost:3000 web socket server
```

```ts
//client side browser code
import {SocioClient} from 'socio/dist/core-client' //this way for both JS and TS
const sc = new SocioClient('ws://localhost:3000', {verbose:true, name:'Main'}); //create as many as you like
await sc.ready(); //wait to establish the connection

//will recall the callback whenever the Users table data gets altered
const id = sc.Subscribe({sql:'SELECT * FROM Users;--socio'}, (res:object) => {
    console.log(res);
});

//send a single query and wait for its result
console.log(await sc.Query('INSERT INTO Users (name, num) VALUES(:name, :num);--socio', {name:'bob', num:42})); //sanatize dynamic data yourself in QueryWrap!
sc.Unsubscribe(id); //notify the server.
```

**Dont be shy to try this out on your small project. Feedback from real world use cases is much appreciated ü•∞**

## Does it scale? ‚öñÔ∏è

Currently the performance is neglegable for small projects. I havent stress tested yet, as its still early dev, but i optimize my data structures, where i can as i go. Current estimate is about 100 concurrent users should be a breeze on a cheap Linode server. There are plans for more optimizations for less traffic, but i also expect your backend DB to be set up properly with table indexing and caching queries.

## Sportsmanship ü§ù

The use of the Socio lib **does not** prohibit the use of standard HTTP technologies. Even better - socio server can be configured to run on your existing http webserver, like one that you'd create with express.js. Since WebSockets are established over HTTP, then take over with their own protocol. Though, seeing as they are different technologies, there are situations where you'd need to "stitch" your own solutions between the two, e.g. tracking sessions.

## Caveats

For SQL queries the automagic happens because i regex parse the strings myself with simple patterns. The most basic usecases should be covered, but more complex SQL queries are not. Situations like: nested queries; multiple queries in a single string. Only table names are extracted, so sometimes subscriptions would receive an update, even though for its specific WHERE clauses it would logically not have changed data. E.g. if you alter a specific users info on a Users table, all subscribed users would get an update. I am planning to fix these, but there are no great solutions.

HTTP has well established session patterns using cookies. WebSockets do not. They are identified only by the TCP pipes id's, which i keep track of. You can quite easily mimic cookie sessions on whatever backend by using SocioServer hooks with SocioSession id's.

I cannot guarantee perfect safety of the query encryption. Neither can anyone, though. And neither can traditional HTTP backends. Every year new scientific papers come out breaking previously thought "unbreakable, future-proof" cryptographic algorithms. You may use SocioServer hooks to double check the incoming data yourself for your peace of mind.

The SocioSecurity Vite plugin searches many types of frontend script file extensions and will encrypt any string that ends with --socio[-args]. Careful.

You should be using WSS:// and HTTPS:// protocols for everything, so that the data is secure over the network. But that's easier said than done.

## Contributing ü•∞
As this is an open source project that i spend my free time on, perhaps someone else would like to help with various things:
* Ideas for better parsing of the SQL to also extract WHERE clause info, that would help minimize DB calls and websocket traffic, and improve performance overall
* Ideas for serious data structures of subscription dependency tracking - directional graph or tree or smth. Currently a custom format dictionary object.
* "Socio Rooms": a plugin that creates and manages general WebSocket "rooms", such that the sockets are isolated and synced with each other, but not the whole backend. For party games like Kahoot, or Live Collaboration setups etc. (Yjs CRDT integration could be used for this)
* Socio-HTTP cookie session plugin, that stitches the two together in some useful way. Express.js has popular plugins for session management, perhaps we can integrate SocioSession.client_id on the session object.
* Starter template projects for various front-end and back-end tech stacks with Socio setup
* Web bundler HMR mechanisms seem pretty complex, perhaps someone wants to make a plugin or recommend some basic solution? The idea is for the server to push new css, js, html files or chunks to be replaced on all clients live - CI/CD automation.

## TODOs üìù
* Database hook function integration instead of manually parsing SQL and updating clients.
* Better SQL dependency distinguisher on queries
* Threading paralization pipelines for async querry queues (perhaps offloading queries to another machine)
* Caching and dedup UPD msg kind
* Redo the update dependency mechanism to serious data structures - dependency graph or tree or smth
* Different solution for sql parsing. Perhaps the 40MB js lib... (but that seems insane to me)
* plenty more

## Name:
"Socio.js" comes from the latin verb "socio", which means to link or associate. Since this lib syncs your frontend and backend. Its also a play on words for "WebSockets" and "IO".

I also have no idea how to describe this lib with technical terms, so let me know if you know :) also before starting this lib, i researched for something similar, but didnt find anything that does exactly this. Let me know if you are aware of a similar lib and i will include a link to it here!
